### Assignment description
Create a simple storefront and e-commerce site. There will be at least 3 products that you have to load from an outside file. All routes must return JSON formatted data that the front-end can then use. You will also need to connect with the Avalara tax rate API to get tax rates for the location the user enters.

### Our concept
We have created a designer water company called Bimini (named for the mythical home of the fountain of youth).  
The back end will be making an API with our three main products (all waters of various degrees of price and quality)  
and the front end will be making a clean and efficient site that accesses this API and allows people to order our products.
